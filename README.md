# General-Distribution

This repository presents a modularized implementation of statistical distribution classes in Python, organized within the "distribution" folder. Three key files play essential roles in encapsulating statistical concepts:

- **general_distribution.py:**
  - Defines a general distribution class.
  - Contains fundamental methods applicable to various distribution types.

- **binomial_distribution.py:**
  - Inherits from the general distribution class.
  - Specializes in handling binomial distributions.
  - Includes methods specific to binomial distributions.

- **gaussian_distribution.py:**
  - Inherits from the general distribution class.
  - Specializes in handling Gaussian distributions.
  - Includes methods tailored to Gaussian distributions.

The hierarchical structure promotes efficient code reuse and maintainability. In the main directory, the "test.py" script orchestrates the verification of these classes. It likely involves creating instances of the distribution classes and applying their methods for comprehensive testing. Accompanying this script are two data files tailored for assessing the robustness and accuracy of the implemented statistical distribution classes.

This repository is designed to facilitate the understanding and application of various statistical distribution concepts in a structured and modular manner.
